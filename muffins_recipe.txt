Grab-n-Go Pancake Muffins

SERVINGS: 
6

INGREDIENTS 

1/4 cups plain yogurt
2 tablespoons unsalted butter (melted)
2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups blanched almond flour
1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1/4 teaspoons sea salt
2 eggs (1 egg white)
1/3 cups berries (diced fresh)

DIRECTIONS

1
    Preheat KitchenAid® 12” Convention Bake Countertop Oven to 350°F. Grease a KitchenAid® Nonstick 6-Cavity Muffin Pan with butter or palm shortening; set aside.
2
    Place all of the liquid ingredients into a blender or food processor, except for the eggs. Then place all of the dry ingredients on top. Cover and blend on low 10-15 seconds just long enough to combine the ingredients (batter will be thick.)
3
    Add the eggs and egg white; blend on low about 20-30 seconds just until the eggs are well incorporated into the batter (do not overmix or muffins will not be tender.)
4
    Evenly divide the batter among the prepared muffin pan, filling each cavity just 1/3 full. Add a few berries to each cup. Then evenly divide the remaining batter among the muffin cups and top with additional berries.
5
    Bake for 18-20 minutes, until slightly golden brown on top and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.
6
    Allow muffins to cool 2-3 minutes in the tin. Then run a knife around the edges of each cup and invert the muffin tin over a sheet of parchment to remove.
